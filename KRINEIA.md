## Notes

### Archived fork

This repository is an archived fork of `anthropics/skills`. No KRINEIA chain is bootstrapped. If this fork is ever un-archived and brought into active development, it must:

1. Bootstrap a genesis receipt in `_receipts/krineia/primary.jsonl`.
2. Adopt the full HUMMBL Repo Standard v0.1 artifact stack.
3. Open an ADR documenting the transition.

### No active governance

Archived forks do not require receipts, ADRs, or handoff notes. The fork boundary is declared in `HUMMBL_FORK.md` and `hummbl.repo.yaml`.
